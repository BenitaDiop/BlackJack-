    "A firm is attempting to evaluate the quality of its sales staff and is trying to find an examination or series of tests that may reveal the potential for good performance in sales. The firm has selected a random sample of 50 sales people and has evaluated each on 3 measures of performance: X 1 = growth of sales, X 2 = profitability of sales, and X 3 = new-account sales. Each of the 50 individuals took each of 4 tests, which purported to measure X 4 = creativity, X 5 = mechanical reasoning, X 6 = abstract reasoning, and X 7 = mathematicalability, respectively. \n",
